<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is BÃ¡rbara, I'm currently 31 years old. I've just started studing html and so far I've been enjoying it and I wanna keep studying to be a web developer.</p>

<p>I'm a creative person, I like photography and editing and manipulating photos. I have some experience with photoshop, I've been playing with it since my teens. I also tried some video editing but it was quite shallow.

<p>I have many hobbies. When I have free time, I enjoy coloring, play indie and casual games, doing puzzles and watch different kinds of series, mainly documentaries about other cultures. </p>
